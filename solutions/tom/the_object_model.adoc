== Exercise 1

=== How do we create an object in Ruby?
We define the method between keywords `class` and `end`, and call the class method `::new` on that class.

=== Example
.library.rb
[source,ruby,indent=0]
----
class Library
end

local_library = Library.new # local_library is now an instance of Library
----

== Exercise 2

=== What is a module? What is its purpose? How do we use them with our classes?
A collection of behaviors that can be included in other classes by `include`, or *mixin*. Modules can't be instantiated.

=== Example
.library_with_module.rb
[source,ruby,indent=0]
----
module Help
  def offer_help
    "Hello, how can we help you?"
  end
end

class Library
  include Help
end

class ConvenientStore
  include Help
end

vaski = Library.new
puts vaski.offer_help

seven_eleven = ConvenientStore.new
puts seven_eleven.offer_help
----
